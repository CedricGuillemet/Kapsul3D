<h2>Overview</h2>
<p>This library allows creating, modifying and extracting zip archives in the
compatible way with PKZIP (2.5 and higher) and WinZip. Supported are all
possible operations on the zip archive: creating, extracting, adding, deleting
files from the archive, modifications of the existing archive. There is also the
support for creating and extracting multiple disk archives (on non-removable
devices as well) and for password encryption and decryption. This module uses
compression and decompression functions from zlib library by Jean-loup Gailly
and Mark Adler.</p>
<h2>How to integrate with the project</h2>
<p>Zip is a static library and statically links to compiled zlib.lib (version
1.13 nowadays). The zlib library can be replaced with a newer version providing
you also replace the files: &quot;zlib.h&quot; and &quot;zconf.h&quot; in the
Zip project. The Zip library uses MFC in a shared library as a Release and Debug
Configuration. Your project must use MFC in the same way in the appropriate
project configuration. You may need to adapt this to your needs. To add Zip
library functionality to your project you need to link the library to the
project. You can do this in at least two ways (in both cases you need to include
ZipArchive.h header in your sources like this: #include &quot;ZipArchive.h&quot;):</p>
<h4>Method 1</h4>
<p>Add &quot;..\Zip\debug(release)\Zip.lib&quot; to <em>Project
Settings-&gt;Link-&gt;Input-&gt;Object/library modules</em> and add Zip
directory to the preprocessor searches (<em>Project Settings -&gt; C++ -&gt;
Preprocessor -&gt; Additional include directories</em>).</p>
<h4>Method 2 (simpler)</h4>
<p>Insert Zip project into workspace and set project dependencies (your project
dependent on Zip project).</p>
<h2>How to use</h2>
<p>The details about using this library are in the sources. The example
available for download at the bottom of the page is an almost complete
compression\decompression program. There are only main issues mentioned below
about using this library. If you have a question about using the library and you
can't find the answer here, don't hesitate to ask.</p>
<h3>Compression and decompression</h3>
<p>There are some functions defined for fast operations on archive; among
others: AddNewFile(), ExtractFile(), DeleteFile(). You only need to call
functions Open() - before and Close() - after using them.<br>
Remember to call Close() function when you finish working with CZipArchive
class.</p>
<h3>Multi-disk archives</h3>
<p>This library supports two kinds of multi-disk archives:<br>
1. Disk spanning performed in the compatible way with all other main zip
programs. It means that the archive can only be created on a removable device,
the size of the volume is auto-detected and the label is written to the disk. To
use this kind of disk spanning you need to define a static callback function for
changing disks and set it with SetSpanCallback() function.<br>
2. Disk spanning performed in the internal mode, called in the sources TD span
mode. This allows creating multi disk archives also on non-removable devices and
with user-defined volume size. There is no need to set callback function in this
mode.</p>
<p>This two disk spanning modes create volumes with compatible internal
structure. It means that you can easily convert the volumes created in one mode
to the other one by renaming the files (in TD mode each volume but last has a
number as an extension). To convert the archive from TD to PKZIP compatible
archive, copy each file to the removable media, giving them the extension
&quot;.zip&quot;. You should also label each disk with the appropriate label
starting from &quot;pkback# 001&quot;.</p>
<p>There is a limited functions set available during work with multi-disk
archives. Only adding is allowed when creating an archive and only extracting
and testing when opening an existing one. Deleting files from these archives
isn't allowed in any of these cases.</p>
<p>Class CZipArchive uses write buffer to make write operations extremely fast.
You can change its size with SetAdvanced() function. While creating a multi-disk
archive, set the size of the buffer to the maximum size of the volume&nbsp; for
the best performance.</p>
<p>The popular archivers such as PKZIP and WinZip cannot operate on archive in
TD span mode. You need to convert them to PKZIP span mode (have a look above).
Remember about copying the files to the removable media (it does not comply with
Winzip, which can extract a multi-disk archive from any media but only from the
fixed location on the drive).</p>
<h3>Password encryption and decryption</h3>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; This library supports creating and extracting of the
password protected archives. There are several issues you should be aware of
when using this feature. To set the password for the file to be added or
extracted call the function SetPassword() with the password as the argument. To
clear the password call this function without arguments or with an empty string
argument. The function has no effect on a closed archive and on the currently
opened file (whether new or existing) inside archive. During opening an archive
the password is cleared and it is not changed if the file inside archive is
opened. You can set different passwords for different files inside the same
archive, but remember to set it BEFORE opening the file. You cannot use ASCII
characters with codes above 127 in a password, if you do so, the function
SetPassword() returns false and the password is cleared. If the password is
cleared, no encryption or decryption take place.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; You can find out what files are password encrypted by calling
CZipArchive::GetFileInfo() which fills the structrure CZipFileHeader with data,
and then the method IsEncrypted() of this structure. If it returns true, the
file needs a password to extract.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp; The successful extraction of the encrypted file doesn't always mean
that the password is correct. CZipArchive doesn't check for a crc if
m_info.m_uUncomprLeft is not zero in the function CZipArchive::CloseFile(). In
some cases bad password causes that this value is not zero, so you have to check
also for the return value of this function (it returns -1 in this case). You can
also check the size of the extracted file since it is smaller than it should be.</p>
<h3>Self extract support</h3>
<p>The library automatically detects self-extracting archives. This is the
simplest self-extract code :</p>
<!-- start a block of source code -->
<pre>
int APIENTRY WinMain(HINSTANCE hInstance,
HINSTANCE hPrevInstance,
LPSTR lpCmdLine,
int nCmdShow)
{
	CZipArchive zip;

	// get path of executable
	TCHAR szBuff[_MAX_PATH];
	if (!::GetModuleFileName(hInstance, szBuff, _MAX_PATH))
		return -1;

	CString szDest;
	// ...
	// add the code here to get the destination directory from the user 
	// for example:
	/* CBrowseForFolder bf;
	   bf.strTitle = _T(&quot;Select directory to extract files&quot;);
	   if (!bf.GetFolder(szDest))
	       return -1;
	*/
	// class CBrowseForFolder is included in the example project
	// remember about including the header!

	zip.Open(szBuff, CZipArchive::openReadOnly); 
	// openReadOnly mode is necessary for self extract archives
	for (WORD i = 0; i &lt; zip.GetNoEntries(); i++)
		zip.ExtractFile(i, szDest);

	zip.Close();
	return 0;
	// this code will not work for the encrypted archives since it is needed
	// to get the password from the user ( a small addition to the 
	// existing code I suppose )
}
<!-- end the block of source code -->

</pre>
<p>After compiling it and appending a zip archive to it (e.g. with the DOS
command: <em>copy /b SelfExtract.exe + ZipFile.zip FinalFile.exe</em>) we have a
self extracting archive.</p>
<h3>Testing the integrity of the archive</h3>
<p>The new functions has been provided to allow the testing of the integrity of
the archive. The first one is <em>CZipArchive::TestFile </em>which is a
comprehensive testing function, but if you need a different functionality, you
can make your own by taking advantage of the second function provided: <em>CZipArchive::CloseFileAfterTestFailed.
</em>The detailed description and the example of use are provided in the sources
and in the example project.</p>
<h3>Exceptions</h3>
<p>The library throws the following exceptions: CMemoryException, CFileExeption
and CZipException. The first two don't need an explanation. The last is thrown
when some internal error occurs. Handling them may be done in the following way:</p>
<pre>
try
{
	// ...
	// some operations on Zip library
}
catch (CException* e)
{
	if (e-&gt;IsKindOf( RUNTIME_CLASS( CZipException )))
	{
		CZipException* p = (CZipException*) e;
		//... and so on 
	}
	else if (e-&gt;IsKindOf( RUNTIME_CLASS( CFileException )))
	{
		CFileException* p = (CFileException*) e;
		//... and so on 
	} 
	else
	{
		// the only possibility is a memory exception I suppose
		//... and so on 
	}
	e-&gt;Delete();
}
</pre>
<h3>Handling the extra field</h3>
<p>The extra field of the file can be different in the local and central
headers. To set the extra filed in the local header set it in <em>header</em>
parameter of <font size="3"><em>CZipArchive::OpenNewFile </em>function<em>. </em>After
that the extra field is written to the local header and cleared. You should call
<em>CZipArchive::SetExtraField </em>function anytime after opening the new file
(but before closing it) to set the file extra field in the central directory.</font></p>
<h3>Sample application</h3>
<p>To run the example, integrate first Zip library into it (Zip library is not
included in the example, you must download it separately); you should be asked
at the beginning about the location of the Zip project, if not, use one of the
integration methods described above. If you don't put Zip library project at the
same directory level what the sample application is, you also have to change the path pointing
to ZipArchive.h in the file testzipdlgdlg.h.</p>
  <h3>Linking errors</h3>
  <p>When you experience linking errors (mostly <em>LNK2005)</em> you need to
  make sure that the library and your program are both using
  single-threaded or both multithreaded library. The option <em>&quot;Project-&gt;Settings-&gt;
  c/c++ -&gt;Code Generation-&gt;Use run-time library&quot; </em>should be set
  to the same value in the ZipArchive library and the program project options.
  <p>If it doesn't help, try recompiling the zlib library ( <em>zlib.lib</em>
  provided with the project is compiled from a release configuration and using <font SIZE="2">Multithreaded</font> 
  DLL run-time library ). You can download the zlib library
  sources from <a href="http://software.artpol.com.pl/d_zip.html.">http://software.artpol.com.pl/d_zip.html.</a>
  Use <em>zlibstat</em> project. Set <em>&quot;Use run-time library&quot;</em>
  option to the same value as you set it in ZipArchve library and your program
  configurations. Compile the Release configuration of the zlib library and
  replace with it the file <em>zlib.lib</em> in the ZipArchive folder. You may
  however experience linking warnings or errors while compiling the Debug
  configuration. To eliminate them do as follows:
  <ul>
    <li>compile Debug and Release configuraions of the zlib library
    <li>copy <em>zlib_d.lib</em> from Debug and <em>zlib.lib</em> from Release
      directories to the ZipArchive directory
    <li>add these files to the ZipArchive project <em>(Project -&gt; Add To
      Project -&gt; Files...)</em>
    <li>go to the project setting dialog <em>(Project -&gt; Settings)</em>
    <li>select debug configurations <em>(Setting For -&gt; Multiple
      Configurations)</em> such as Debug and Unicode Debug
    <li>select <em>zlib.lib</em> file, then the General tab, and check the box <em>&quot;Exclude
      file from build&quot;</em>
    <li>select release configurations
    <li>select <em>zlib_.lib</em> and exclude it from these builds</li>
  </ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
